- **QR Assistant**: Scan QR codes for additional assistance.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with `tkinter` and `ttkbootstrap` for an intuitive user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Tkinter for UI)
- **OpenCV** (for image capture and processing)
- **PIL (Pillow)** (for image handling)
- **Requests** (for API communication)
- **TTK Bootstrap** (for enhanced UI styling)
